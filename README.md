This code uses the Tesseract.js library to process the image and extract the text from it. The extracted text is then printed to the console.

To use this code in your app, you will need to install the Tesseract.js library using npm install tesseract.js. You will also need to add the file input element to your app's HTML code, so that users can upload an image to be processed.

You will likely need to add additional features and functionality to your app, such as the ability to save the extracted text to a file, or to search for specific words within the text.
